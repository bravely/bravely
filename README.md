Hi there! I'm a self-taught software engineer who has been in the industry since 2012. While I might have first come to this line of work as a means of living, I've honestly found that I love the freedom it's given me. I've begun a newsletter about communication and organizational techniques, as I spend so much time thinking about them. Also, I have a headphone wall, which I use to listen to everything you can imagine, and endanger my family's financial prospects.

## Installation

One of these is required:
* `Mentorship v0.1+` - Always open for this
* `Second Brain` - I spend a lot of time thinking of more pragmatic ways computers can enhance us.
* `Civic Education & Engagement` - I want to empower everyone I can to get more involved in their world.

### Note About Breaking Changes
My last name is `Demarest-Mays`. I don't respond to my 1.0 name, `Mays`.

This is my long-form writing. I'm just getting started after a long hiatus from writing, so I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to cover here. Some of what I'm interested in is Stress Management, Communication, Organizational Techniques(both for yourself and within your organization), but I've found recently I've also been writing about some more contentious topics. Feedback always welcome!

This is more of a by-the-moment view of my life. I'm very open and do my best to stay positive, but feel free to reach out!

### Family

My wife Allison isn't just my better half, she's my partner is all parts of my life. I wouldn't be half of who I am day to day without her, she's my secret superpower. Also, in March of 2020, we adopted a baby who is helping to uncover a hidden killer app for me: Fatherhood.

### Boise

We live in Boise, ID. I got stuck here after meeting my wife here just before I was planning on moving away, and I thank God every time I'm reminded of it. Boise's a terrible place to vacation(unless you love doing outdoor stuff- Bogus Basin is amazing year-round), but it's one of the best cities you can live in, thanks to a responsive government, amazing and diverse food, and just a lot of great people. If you ever come through, please reach out, I'd love to hang out(with masks, if it's still crazy-times).

Hi there! I'm a self-taught software engineer who has been in the industry since 2012. While I might have first come to this line of work as a means of living, I've honestly found that I love the freedom it's given me. I've begun a newsletter about communication and organizational techniques, as I spend so much time thinking about them. Also, I have a headphone wall, which I use to listen to everything you can imagine, and endanger my family's financial prospects.

## Installation

One of these is required:
* `Mentorship v0.1+` - Always open for this
* `Second Brain` - I spend a lot of time thinking of more pragmatic ways computers can enhance us.
* `Civic Education & Engagement` - I want to empower everyone I can to get more involved in their world.

### Note About Breaking Changes
My last name is `Demarest-Mays`. I don't respond to my 1.0 name, `Mays`.

You can readily get my thoughts either by going to my Twitter or Substack blog.

This is my long-form writing. I'm just getting started after a long hiatus from writing, so I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to cover here. Some of what I'm interested in is Stress Management, Communication, Organizational Techniques(both for yourself and within your organization), but I've found recently I've also been writing about some more contentious topics. Feedback always welcome!

This is more of a by-the-moment view of my life. I'm very open and do my best to stay positive, but feel free to reach out!

Hi there! I'm a self-taught software engineer who has been in the industry since 2012. While I might have first come to this line of work as a means of living, I've honestly found that I love the freedom it's given me. I've begun a newsletter about communication and organizational techniques, as I spend so much time thinking about them. Also, I have a headphone wall, which I use to listen to everything you can imagine, and endanger my family's financial prospects.

## Installation

One of these is required:
* `Mentorship v0.1+` - Always open for this
* `Second Brain` - I spend a lot of time thinking of more pragmatic ways computers can enhance us.
* `Civic Education & Engagement` - I want to empower everyone I can to get more involved in their world.

### Note About Breaking Changes
My last name is `Demarest-Mays`. I don't respond to my 1.0 name, `Mays`.
